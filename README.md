# 🛡️ Image Captioning Generator

This project implements a deep learning model to automatically generate descriptive captions for images. It uses a hybrid architecture combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image feature extraction and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for sequence generation.
